The Clipboard service contains two methods:

beginCopy — This method is designed to prepare a string to be copied later. This is mainly used when a large string is about to be copied. Large strings may take too long to successfully render and be copied in the same tick.

copy— This method is designed to copy the provided text into the user’s clipboard. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.
